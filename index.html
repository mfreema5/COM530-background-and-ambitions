    <h2>&ldquo;Background and Ambitions&rdquo;</h2>

    <p>
      <em>I want to write.</em>
      I want to find solutions to problems, and share them with other people.  The sharing of any solutions I find is as important as the finding.  Well, maybe not as important, but it is vital.  If I can&rsquo;t show people the solution I&rsquo;ve found and/or implemented, and then see it being used, I feel like I&rsquo;ve wasted my time.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>I want to write.</em>
      I want to help others understand things.  I will learn new things solely for the purpose of explaining them to other people.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>I want to write.</em>
      I want to find ways to communicate information more clearly than it has previously been presented.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>I want to write.</em>
      Though maybe “write” isn&rsquo;t the most accurate word.  Or maybe it is, and I just apply too narrow of a meaning to it.  What I want to do is beyond putting words together—not that putting words together can&rsquo;t be a monumental task in itself—but also structure documents, and structure the way that people interact with documents.

    <p>
      So, when I say, &ldquo;<em>I want to write,</em>&rdquo; does that really mean that I want to create web pages?  Maybe.  Terms like &ldquo;web designer&rdquo; often just strike me as trendy and vacuous.  I prefer to think in terms of wanting to find communication solutions.  Solutions that will often involve web pages because of the ubiquity of web browsers, and web browsing capabilities.
