<h2>&ldquo;Background and Ambitions&rdquo; assignment</h2>

<p><em>You will write four to five paragraphs about your background as well as your ambitions for this class and your career at IIT and beyond.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>I want to write.  I want to find solutions to problems, and share them with other people.  The sharing of any solutions I find is as important as the finding.  Well, maybe not as important, but it is vital.  If I can&rsquo;t show people the solution I&rsquo;ve found and/or implemented, and then see it being used, I feel like I&rsquo;ve wasted my time.</p>

<p>I want to write.  I want to help others understand things.  I will learn new things solely for the purpose of explaining them to other people.</p>

<p>I want to write.  I want to find ways to communicate information more clearly than it has previously been presented.</p>

<p>I want to write.  Though maybe “write” isn&rsquo;t the most accurate word.  Or maybe it is, and I just apply too narrow of a meaning to it.  What I want to do is beyond putting words together—not that putting words together can&rsquo;t be a monumental task in itself—but also structure documents, and structure the way that people interact with documents.</p>

<p>So, when I say, &ldquo;I want to write&rdquo;, does that really mean that I want to create web pages?  Maybe.  Terms like “web designer” just strike me as trendy and vacuous.  I prefer to think in terms of wanting to find communication solutions, that will often involve web pages because of the ubiquity of web browsers, and web browsing capabilities.</p>
