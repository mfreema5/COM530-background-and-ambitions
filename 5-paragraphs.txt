I want to write.  I want to find solutions to problems, and share them with other people.  The sharing of any solutions I find is as important as the finding.  Well, maybe not as important, but it is vital.  If I can't show people the solution I've found and/or implemented, and then see it being used, I feel like I've wasted my time.

I want to write.  I want to help others understand things.  I will learn new things solely for the purpose of explaining them to other people.  I don't know that I have a desire to teach, so much as a desire to communicate.

I want to write.  I want to find ways to communicate information more clearly than it has previously been presented.

I want to write.  Though maybe “write” isn't the most accurate word.  Or maybe it is, and I just apply too narrow of a meaning to it.  What I want to do is beyond putting words together—not that putting words together can't be a monumental task in itself—but also structure documents, and structure the way that people interact with documents.

Do I want to create web pages?  Maybe.  Terms like “web designer” just strike me as trendy and vacuous.  I prefer to think in terms of wanting to find communication solutions, that will often involve web pages because of the ubiquity of web browsers, and web browsing capabilities.
